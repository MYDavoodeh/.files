kblayout: a wrapper for `setxkbmap`

Requirements are `setxkbmap`, basic core commands (`awk`, `grep`, etc.) and
optionally `dmenu` for marked commands

Viable commands:
  active
         prints the active layout (bind to your statusbar)
  cycle  cycles through a list of languages provided to it (bind to your switch
         layout combination)
         this is basically switch, ran repeatedly without messing with the order
  get    prints all the languages and variants behind your active layout
  set    sets keyboard layout(s) to the language(s) given
  switch
         adds or activates a layout among previously set layouts. If multiple
         layouts are provided, cycles through them and while keeping prevously
         set layouts in memory. Useful for tertiary languages that are used
         occasionally.
* list   puts a list of available "basic" layouts in `dmenu` for you to choose from
         if you just want to list installed layouts
         use `localctl list-x11-keymap-layouts`
* vars   much like `list` but also asks for variants

If none of commands above is chosen, script assumes `set` as the default.

Use "xx" as input where xx is the language code (us, ir, ru, dk...).
Alternatively, use "xx-variant" if you do not want the "basic" variant of a
layout. List available variants with `localectl list-x11-keymap-variants xx`.

Note that using "xx-" without a variant produces unexpected and buggy results.

Set Env var $STATUSBAR (default value "dwmblocks") to your statusbar of choice
to have it singalled with "30" each time you run the script.

Examples:
  - Set keyboard layout to `us`:
    kblayout us

  - Set keyboard layout to `us`:
    kblayout set us

  - Get the query of all the active layouts (output like `us ir`):
    kblayout get

  - Cycle through `us`, `ir` and `ru` in `phonetic` variant:
    kblayout cycle us ir ru-phonetic

  - Add `ru-phonetic` temporarily to the head of the queue (for example if
    currently active layouts are `us ir`, the new ones will be `ru-phonetic us
    ir`, or if they are `us ir ru-phonetic`, simply skips `ir` and goes to
    `ru-phonetic`):
    kblayout switch ru-phonetic

  - Cycle through temporarily, newly added `ru` and `us` at the head of the
    queue while remembering/keeping the previous layouts at the end (upon
    repeated execusion switches between `ru` and `us` while keeping previously
    active layouts, say `fr es us`, at the end, resulting in such queue `ru us
    fr es`):
    kblayout switch ru us

  - Show a `dmenu` to select a langauge from:
    kblayout list

  - Show a `dmenu` to select a language and its variant:
    kblayout variants'
